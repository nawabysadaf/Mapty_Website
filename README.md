# Mapty Website

## 📌 Project Description

Welcome to **Mapty Website**, a practice web application developed as part of my learning journey in **advanced JavaScript and API integration.** This project was created to reinforce the concepts I learned through an online JavaScript course, specifically focusing on working with real-world APIs such as the Google Maps API.
The main functionality of Mapty allows users to mark any location on an interactive map and attach a custom note to each marked point. Through this project, I practiced key JavaScript skills such as asynchronous programming, event handling, data interaction, and utilizing third-party APIs.
Please note that this project is strictly for practice and educational purposes only. The original concept and design belong to the course creator, and I do not claim ownership of them. My goal in recreating this project is to apply, experiment with, and better understand the lessons taught in the course.
Feel free to browse the code and structure for learning or inspiration.
